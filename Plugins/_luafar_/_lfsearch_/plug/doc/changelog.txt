------------------------------------------------------------------
  Legend:   [+] added;   [-] deleted;   [*] changed;   [!] fixed;
------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-01-28, v2.4.0
  [*] Removed option "pick search string from plugin history".
      (Far dialog history is always used).
  [+] "Find files" from panels.
  [+] GUIDs added to the editor and panel dialogs.
  [+] Plugin got a SysId (0x10001) for calling with 'callplugin'
      (currently this call will only display its 2-nd parameter).

2010-12-26, v2.3.0
  [*] Search scope of Repeat operation is always "global" and never "block",
      regardless of the previous operation's search scope.
  [+] Search string can be picked from Far history (selectable from the
      configuration dialog).
  [!] Preset operation data is placed into plugin history, the same way as
      "usual operation" data. That means Repeat operation will properly work
      after a preset operation.
  [+] 64-bit build added (works with 64-bit LuaFAR).
  [*] Plugin keeps its data in "%APPDATA%\LuaFAR Search" directory
      (was: in the plugin directory).


2010-11-14, v2.2.0
  [+] Improved performance of search.
  [+] Improved interactivity during lengthy operations.
  [+] "Show All" command: matched substrings are highlighted.


2010-10-27, v2.1.1
  [!] rex_onig.dll and rex_pcre.dll renamed to *.dl, in order to avoid their
      loading/unloading by Far.
  [!] PCRE library: did not work with PCRE versions older than 8.10.
  [!] All regex libraries (except Lua) in non-regex searches: pattern |
      was being "found", even when | was not present in the searched text.


2010-08-30, v2.1.0
  [+] "Ignore spaces" option become available for Lua regexp library.
  [!] Lua regexp library: patterns starting with ^ worked from any position.
  [!] Reverse search: patterns ending with $ worked from any position.
      Note: subpatterns {m,n} can still work incorrectly in reverse search.
  [+] Self-test operates with all available regexp libraries.


2010-07-25, v2.0.1
  [!] plugin didn't work installed on a non-ASCII path, due to using
      plain Lua variants of (require, loadfile, io).
  [+] PCRE: \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W work with Unicode characters
      (PCRE 8.10 required).


2010-06-28, v2.0.0
  [+] First Unicode version.
  [*] Far 2.0 + LuaFAR 2.3 are required.
  [+] User-selectable regular expression library
      (Far Regex, Lua Regex, Oniguruma (optional), PCRE (optional)).
  [+] "Scope" and "Origin" for all operations.
  [+] Search and replace in reverse direction.
  [+] "Delete empty line" in replace operation.
  [*] "Repeat" operation now uses own plugin's history rather than
      "SavedDialogHistory" registry key.
  [*] Line Filter skips a line when its function returns true
      (the opposite to what it used to be).
  [-] "Wrap around" option.


2010-02-04, v0.9.1
  [*] LuaFAR 1.1 is required (was: 1.0).
  [*] PCRE ver. 8.01 is embedded (was: ver. 8.00)
  [!] LuaFAR version check was done after the exported functions were
      already connected (that is, too late).


2009-12-24, v0.9
  [*] LuaFAR 1.0 is required (was: >= 0.8).
  [*] PCRE built with no recursion: slower but safer.
  [*] Empty search pattern is not accepted: error message is displayed.
  [*] Pressing Enter on the dialog containing an invalid field value
      will display error message without closing the dialog.
  [!] Replace pattern, sequences of the kind \xhh :
      -- They were affected by the text case modifiers, such as \u or \L.
      -- They are still affected by encoding conversions (DOS to Win, etc.)
         but that appears too hard to fix.
         [*] For that reason, only values \xhh <= \x7F are allowed.
  [!] Replace pattern:
      \x25 was treated as an empty string rather than the percent sign.
  [+] The plugin's menu made expandable: user scripts can be added.
      API for access to the plugin internals is provided. This allows
      to implement presets, automatic operations and other interesting things.
  [+] Self-test added, as a user script.
  [*] Line Filter: made function (was: expression).
  [!] "Repeat" operation under Far 2: search/replace patterns were picked
      from the registry without the required codepage conversion.


2009-11-23, v0.8
  [*] PCRE built with no UTF-8 support, as the plugin currently
      does not support UTF-8 search. (This removed 95 KiB from the DLL).
  [!] Eliminated excessive screen flickering during repetitive replace.
  [!] Accommodated to the changed dialog history format introduced
      in Far 2.0.1208 (the correct format is determined at run time).
  [+] Russian help file added.
  [*] In 'Function Mode' and in 'Line Filter', the preset variable for
      the regex library is "rex" (was: "lib").


2009-11-12, v0.7
  [!] \E in replace pattern was treated as $E
  [*] PCRE ver. 8.00 is embedded (was: ver. 7.8)
  [*] Lua and LuaFAR libraries are not embedded


2009-02-24, v0.6
  [!] replace prompt dialog covered the line containing a match;
  [!] top screen line position could change when no match was found;
  [!] cursor horizontal position was incorrect after a "manual-mode" replace;
  [+] replace pattern: counter: start value and width can be specified;


2009-02-20, v0.5
  [!] "show all" mode: lines containing binary nuls were displayed truncated;
  [*] an empty string adjacent to previous match will never be matched:
      for example, the pattern ".*" will match any line only once;
  [+] replace pattern: groups can be $0...$9, $A...$F (was: only $0...$9);
  [+] replace pattern: support for text case manipulation;
  [+] replace pattern: support for counter;


2009-02-11, v0.4
  [!] super-slow search in blocks due to reselecting block on each line;
  [!] premature end of search in blocks when replacing text contained \n;
  [!] "wrap around" mode: "$" pattern was found twice on the initial line;
  [*] "repeat" mode: use search and replace patterns from FAR history.
      If either of them was changed by other programs, then "repeat search"
      is performed, even when the last plugin operation was "replace";
  [*] show found matches vertically centered on the screen;
  [*] "show all" mode: show the first match on the line as selected text;
  [*] scope in replace operation is determined by the user (was: automatic);
  [+] checkbox "Replace in selection" on Replace dialog;


2009-02-06, v0.3
  [!] "wrap around" mode: a word couldn't be found if the cursor was
      positioned in the middle of that word;
  [*] better handling of syntax errors in Search and Replace dialogs;
  [+] operation and button "Show All";
  [+] operation and button "Count";
  [+] button "Configuration" on Search and Replace dialogs;


2009-02-01, v0.2
  [+] indication of operation progress on upper status bar;
  [+] support for \r, \n in replacing text;
  [+] support for escape sequences of kind \xhh in replace pattern;
  [-] option "Backslash escapes";
  [*] take search and replace patterns from FAR history whenever applicable;
  [*] use $0 - $9 for groups (rather than %0 - %9) in replace pattern;
  [!] dialog history is saved even when errors occur;


2009-01-24, v0.1
  [+] first public release;
